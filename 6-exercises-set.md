6 exercises set
========

This is a short set of exercises for grounding, coping with anxiety, improving focus, self-centering.

**Reminder:** Between each exercise, try to take a few moments to observe your body and if you notice any changes

## Exercises

### 1.Foot massage

This exercise can be done with a tennis ball, a wine cork, or a massage, instead. This is also the prefered way to start, in some cases - if the person has bunion, for instance.

#### How to
1. stand up, observe your body for 60 to 90 seconds, observe how your breathing, your body posture, any changes
2. sit down, roll one foot on the cork, slowly, feeling the whole foot sole (or do the foot massage)
3. stand up, observe your body for 60 to 90 seconds, observe how your breathing, your body posture, any changes
4. sit down, roll the other foot on the cork, slowly, feeling the whole foot sole
5. stand up, observe your body for 60 to 90 seconds, observe how your breathing, your body posture, any changes

##### Massage approach: 
Start massaging the sole of one foot with your thumbs, in movements as if to spread your sole open (like a dough), then from sole to toe, doing the same movements with toes, then then make circular movements with each toe, three times on each direction, then slightly squeeze all toes and foot, then gently punch your foot sole a few times, then make circular movements with you ankle, using your hands to guide them, three times in each direction, and finish the massage with a gentle caress on your sole.

### 3. Ground grabbing

#### How to
	
Move your foot and toes as if you wanted to grab the floor with them, first one foot, then the other, then both.

### 4. looking at our surroundings

### 5. Core power

### 6. Getting a hold of our strength, incorporating our strength (like a sword or a staff)

## Note

The first time you try these, do the exercises along with someone else, ask them how do they feel, share how it was for you. Changes tend to be significant, for such simple exercises, and when we notice such differences and share them, that also helps in incorporating the change, and bit by bit we can incorporate that more permanently. Short explanation for this: when we stand still, we do so with the posture we are used to. But after we massage our feet, for instance, and stand up again, we'll tend to stand up with a different, more relaxed posture, naturally, and we can notice this.

These exercises were suggested and taught to me by Zélia Fajardini, a psychologist and Bodynamic® professional who has years of pratice with several therapeutical approaches.
I am just sharing this document preferably as a guide for those with whom I have shared the movements in some sort of session, so they can have the explanation saved. If you do find this interesting and want to try them out, I do suggest you check the Bodynamic® Facebook page linked here, and preferably do the exercises for the first time with someone else, so you can share your thoughts and experience afterwards.
